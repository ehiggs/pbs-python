the latest stable pbs_python interface is available from:
    ftp://ftp.surfsara.nl/pub/outgoing/pbs_python.tar.gz

bug resport:
    pbs_python@surfsara.nl

=============== Brief description =============================
Pbs_python interface is a wrapper class for the OPENPBS/TORQUE 
C LIB API.  Now you can write utilities/extensions in Python 
instead of C.  

The Python wrapper class is tested on:

  - Intel cluster debian GNU/LINUX woody/sarge OPENPBS 2.3.16, 
    TORQUE 1.0.1p4, 1.1.0p4 and up

  - For X86_64 systems you have to compile torque/openpbs with 
    the -fPIC option. Else you can not build the python module

  - TRU64 system, NOTE: must rename libnet.a to libpbs_net.a and 
    edit setup.py to reflect the change. There is also a system wide 
    libnet.so.

  - It should run on different OSes.

In the past our Alpha cluster was redhat (6.2)  and we had to 
add '-lots' to the LIBS line

-- Compile and install the package: (Require python 2.1 and higher)

  As for python version 1.6 and higher the procedure is:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

  Debian package:
    debian/rules binary

--- Testing the package:

The test programs are include as a reference how to use the pbs
python module. You have to edit some test programs to reflect
your PBS/Torque installation.

pbsmon.py        - ascii xpbsmon
rack_pbsmon.py   - ascii xpbsmon by rack layout
pbsnodes-a.py    - pbsnodes -a
pbs_version.py   - print server version
set_property.py  - set some node properties
resmom_info.py   - queries the pbs_mom daemon on the nodes
logpbs.py	 - Shows the usage of the PBS logging routines
new_interface.py - Example how to use PBSQuery module
PBSQuery.py      - python <install_path>/PBSQuery.py (has builtin demo)

sara_nodes.py    - We use this program to set the nodes offline/online. when 
                   there are no command line arguments. It will list the 
                   nodes that are down/oflline. For more info see:
                    - https://subtrac.sara.nl/oss/pbs_python/wiki/TorqueExamples

pbs_jobmonitor   - Shows the output of top -u user on the node:
                     * one cycle of top
                     * user: the user the job belongs to

pbs_joblogin     - logs in to the node as the user who invokes this script 
                   (os.getenv('USER'))
