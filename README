This is the new  Python wrapper class for the PBS C LIB API. Now you can write 
utilities/extensions in Python instead of C.  

The Python wrapper class is tested on:
	- Intel cluster debian GNU/LINUX potato/woody PBS 2.2p7
	- Compaq Alpha Cluster red hat 6.2 PBS 2.3. For this platform
          we had to add '-lots' to the LIBS line.
	- It should run on different OSes.

Compile the package:
  Adjust the Makefile to where you installed Python and PBS.

Testing the package:
    pbsmon.py       - ascii xpbsmon
    pbsnodes-a.py   - pbsnodes -a
    pbs_version.py  - print server version
    set_property.py - set some node properties

    The test programs are include as a reference how to use the PBS
    python module. You have to edit some test programs to reflect
    your PBS installation.

The Installation ---

The python PBS module consists of the following files:
  pbscmodule.so
  pbs.py
  pbs.pyc ( will be generated from pbs.py. The first time you load
            the module).

You can install these file in your own directory and use the PYTHONPATH
environment variable or install it in a system wide directory, eg:
	/usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages
