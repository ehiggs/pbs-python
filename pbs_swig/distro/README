This is a Python wrapper class for the PBS C LIB API. Now you can write 
utilities/extensions in Python instead of C.  

The Python wrapper class is tested on:
  - Intel cluster debian GNU/LINUX potato/woody PBS 2.2p7, PBS 2.3.16
  - Compaq Alpha cluster debian GNU/LINUX potato/woody PBS 2.2p7, PBS 2.3.16
  - It should run on different OSes.

In the past our Alpha cluster was redhat (6.2)  and we had to add '-lots'
to the LIBS line

--- Compile and install the package:
  As for python version 1.6 and higher the procedure is:
    python setup.py install

  Python versions lower then 1.6 do not have the distutils
  package default in their installation. You can test it:
  python
  import distutils

  If this succed then use the above procedure else use the procedure below:
    cd src
    Adjust the Makefile to where you installed Python and PBS libraries.
    make

    The python PBS module consists of the following files:
      pbscmodule.so
      pbs.py
      pbs.pyc ( will be generated from pbs.py. The first time you load
              the module).

    You can install these file in your own directory and use the PYTHONPATH
    environment variable or install it in a system wide directory, eg:
      /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages

--- Testing the package:

The test programs are include as a reference how to use the PBS
python module. You have to edit some test programs to reflect
your PBS installation.

pbsmon.py       - ascii xpbsmon
pbsnodes-a.py   - pbsnodes -a
pbs_version.py  - print server version
set_property.py - set some node properties
resmom_info.py  - queries the pbs_mom daemon on the nodes (NEW)
