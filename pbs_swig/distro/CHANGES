=========== Version 2.6

 Fixed a bug in the pbs python module. Forgot to map the pbs_statjob()
 function. This bug prevented to pass 'struct attrl' variables to this
 fucntion. Thanks to Evelyn Shiu for reporting this bug.


=========== Version 2.5
 Added the OpenPbs logging functions (log.h and liblog.a). There
 is an example in the examples directory: logpbs.py

 Fixed a bug in examples/resmom_info.py used the default port for
 pbs_resmon if getservbyname fails.

 Fixed a bug in resmom code. If the user has no permissions to query
 the pbs_mom daemon a empty string is returned. Now we check for
 the empty string. So we do not get a python exception.

 Fixed a bug in setup.py forgot the exit statement when we did not
 find the pbs libraries.

=========== Version 2.3
 Bugfix in the pbsnodes-a.py. Forgot to import the sys module.

 Removed some obsolete code. 

 As for now we make use of the distutils module. So the package
 is automatically compiled and installed in proper directories, usage:
    python setup.py install
 This requires that the package 'distutils' must be installed. As for
 version 1.6 and higher it is in the distribution.

 Added a function that prints the pbs python interface version. So we
 can check if we have the right interface version:
 import pbs
 print pbs.version()
 

=========== Version 2.2

In this release we can query the pbs_mom daemon with the aid of
resource management functions:
   pbs.openrm()
   pbs.closerm()
   pbs.downrm()
   pbs.configrm()
   pbs.addreq()
   pbs.allreq()
   pbs.flushreq()
   pbs.activereq()
   pbs.fullresp()
   pbs.getreq()

There is also a python function:
   pbs.get_mom_values(id, [list]):
     id   - connection id of pbs.openrm(node-name, port-number)
     list - Is a optional paramter. A list of resource keywords

   If 'list' is not supplied then this function will get the values
   for the standard resource keywords, eg uname, loadave, .. + 'arch' 
   depended keywords. The arch feature is only implemented for linux, 
   but it can easily be ported to other oses.

   if 'list' is supplied then we only fetch values for the keywords
   that are in the list.

   The function returns a dictonary. The keys are the resource keywords.

   See 'resmom_info.py' for a example of this new feature.

=========== Version 2.0

The previous version was a simple interface above the PBS C API LIB.  This 
interface has gone a major changes. The most noticeable change is  that
the functions accept/return Python lists instead of C-lists.  So you can now 
use standard Python syntax for manipulating Python lists. If you are familar 
with the Python syntax then you will appreciate this new interface.

NOTE:
  This interface is NOT compatible with the old one

Here are some guidelines to convert your code to the new one:

The constructors for the struct has gone a major change:
  old code:
    temp = pbs.new_attrl();
    attrl_p = pbs.attrlPtr(temp)
    attrl_p.name = 'state'

  new_code:
     attr_l = pbs.new_attrl(1)   // Creates a list of attrl structs length 1
     attr_l[0].name = 'state'


The pbs_stat functions returns Python lists instead of C-lists. There is
NO next field anymore:
  old_code:
    temp = pbs.new_attrl();
    attrl_p = pbs.attrlPtr(temp)
    attrl_p.this = 'NULL'

    nodes = pbs.pbs_statnode(con, "", attrl_p, "NULL")

    while nodes.this != 'NULL':
      print nodes.name

      node_attrl = nodes.attribs
      while node_attrl.this != 'NULL':
        print '\t', node_attrl.name, '=', node_attrl.value
	node_attrl = node_attrl.next

    nodes = nodes.next 


  new_code:
    nodes = pbs.pbs_statnode(con, "", "NULL", "NULL")
    for node in nodes:
      print node.name
      for attrib in node.attribs:
        print '\t', attrib.name, '=', attrib.value

Another advantage is you can use the print statement to show the
connect of attrl and attropl classes:
   attr_l = pbs.new_attrl(2)
   attr_l[0].name = 'bas'
   attr_l[0].value = 'van der Vlies'

   print  attr_l[0]
   >> (bas,,van der Vlies)
    
I hope these examples illustrate the changes. If you specify a wrong type
for a function then function wil raise a Python exception.
